So, use this opportunity to get most of your work done and visualize about how proud you will feel if you achieve this task. But, if you still feel like you need a little motivation. Here are some tips: </p>
<ol style="text-align: left;font-size:20px;">
      <li> Do a quick five minute mediation! You can use some our spotify music suggestions to go along your meditative journey!</li>
      <li> Take a five minute walk outside. Most importantly be mindful of what you do! Don't over do this when your stress level is 1 or 2, because you don't want to loose your productive stage. </li>
      <li> Just sing along and dance to your favorite song or play the playlist from spotify that we embed below!</li>
      </ol>
      <i> Hope you are having fun!</i> 
      <p> Then, you should feel somewhat motivated, and if yes, continue working on your crazy dreams! We hope you achieve it! : ) </p>

SO, I want you to listen to me! It's okay to be like that, and you're not alone, someone out there is going through the same thing as you are! Please avoid taking big decisions during this time. </i></p>
<p> Here are some things you can do to make yourself feel better: </p>
<ol style="text-align: left;font-size:20px;">
      <li> Do a pamper routine! Have a "me time!"Have time for yourself, and don't worry about the people around you for a second! This is not being selfish, it's just that you are getting time to rejounivate.</li>
      <li> After "me time," spend time with your family. Talk to them. Openly. If you don't have someone like that, that's completely alright! And again, you are not the only one like that. Instead, do a brain dump.  
      </li>
      <li> Have the mindset that <b>this is not end of the world!</b></li>
      </ol> 
      <p> Smile. Breathe. Go slowly. </p>
